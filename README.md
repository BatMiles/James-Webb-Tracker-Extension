# James-Webb-Tracker-Extension
A Chrome browswer extension to track the progress of the James Webb Space Telescope

## How to use
This has been submitted to the Chrome store, but review usually takes several weeks and Webb is set to be in orbit around L2 by then, so *shrug*
But! You can download the code from this repository and add it to your own browser without too much trouble.
- download the /dist folder in this repository
- open the chrome browser
- navigate to chrome://extensions/, the chrome extensions page
- toggle on 'developer mode' by clicking the toggle in the upper right of the screen
- click 'Load Unpacked' in the upper left of the screen
- navigate to where you saved this project's code, and upload the folder
- Congrats! You can now access the Webb extension (hehe) from your Chrome browser!
